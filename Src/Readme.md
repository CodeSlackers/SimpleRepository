# Repository Service
This is basically an interface over other repositories and implements the Repository Pattern via Rest methods (Get, Post, Put, Delete).  
I have toyed with implementing patch, but I am not sure how that will look.  
Only two underlying repositories are LiteDB and Mongo, but I would like to eventually do Couch and potentially CosmosDB.
